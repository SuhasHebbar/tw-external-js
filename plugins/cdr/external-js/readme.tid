This plugin adds the ability to externalize plugins as well as the <$text text="TiddlyWiki"/> core code for improved efficiency. This is achieved by applying the "external-js" template to the wiki. Such configuration requires additional supporting file(s) to accompany the standalone wikis. This plugin is intended for the advanced users only.

! Installation

Drag and drop the [[External JS Plugin|$:/plugins/cdr/external-js]] into your wiki, save and reload. Then visit the usage tab of the plugin for further details.
