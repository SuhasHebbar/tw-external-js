This plugin adds the ability to externalize plugins as well as the <$text text="TiddlyWiki"/> core code for improved efficiency. This is achieved by saving a wiki with the "external-js" template. Such configuration requires additional supporting file(s) to accompany the standalone wikis. This plugin is intended for advanced users only.
