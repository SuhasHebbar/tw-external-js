This plugin can externalize plugins as well as the <$text text="TiddlyWiki"/> core code by extending the default "external-js" template. Although such configuration requires additional supporting <$text text="JavaScript"/>(s) for your wikis to load successfully, it allows you to share libraries and drastically reduce disk usage. This plugin is intended for the advanced users only.

! Installation

Drag and drop the [[External JS Plugin|$:/plugins/cdr/external-js]] into your wiki, save and reload. Then visit the usage tab of the plugin for further details.
